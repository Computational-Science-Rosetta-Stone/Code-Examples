# Slide Presentations
There are a collection of technologies for making slides for use in scientific discussions. In this section, we present example slide decks created with tools that emphasize the use of [markdown](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markdown) as a basic authoring language, and modern web browsers as a display device. So these slide presentations depend on CSS and html5 as underlying markup.
