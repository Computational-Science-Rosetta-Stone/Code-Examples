# Random Number Generation
Central to the making of sumulations is the making of (pseudo-)random numbers. These examples focus on the **easy** making of these random numbers using the standard or built in tools for the various scientific languages.

More precise manufacture of random numbers using advanced algorithms will not be covered here (or likely anywhere in this collection; but we are always looking for volunteers!). Nor will we look into the use of external "true" entropy sources.
