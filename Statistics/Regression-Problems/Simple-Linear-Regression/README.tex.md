# Simple Linear Regression Examples
This directory shows examples of running linear regressions in the following packages/languages/systems:
+ R
+ Python (via the Statsmodels package)
+ SPSS
+ Stata

Because linear regression is a relatively simple and well understood process in science, these examples break the rules a little by showing multiple analyses per file. However, this is justified by the fact that a "complete analysis" of a data set usually includes multiple analyses anyway.

## Example Problems
Linear regression is a standard analysis for numerical (often ratio scale) variables, specifically where the predictor (or input or $x$ variables) are used to predict (or estimate) the response (or output or $y$) variable. For linear regression in its simplest form we assume that both $x$ and $y$ are numbers with all the usual properties of numbers. So we **exclude** predicting categories, a problem usually called "linear classification," and predicting probabilities (numbers confined to the interval $[0,1]$ or $(0,1)$) usually modelled as "logistic regression" or a "generalized linear model."
