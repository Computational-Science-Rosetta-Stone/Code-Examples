# Simple (Multiple) Linear Regression Examples
This directory shows examples of running linear regressions in the following packages/languages/systems:
+ R
+ Python (Statsmodels)
+ SPSS
+ Stata

Because linear regression is a relatively simple and well understood process in science, these examples break the rules a little by showing multiple analyses per file. However, this is justified by the fact that a "complete analysis" of a data set usually includes multiple analyses anyway.

## Example Problems
Linear regression is a standard analysis for numerical (often ratio scale) variables, specifically where the predictor (or input or <img src="/Statistics/Regression/tex/332cc365a4987aacce0ead01b8bdcc0b.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=9.39498779999999pt height=14.15524440000002pt/> variables) are used to predict (or estimate) the response (or output or <img src="/Statistics/Regression/tex/deceeaf6940a8c7a5a02373728002b0f.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=8.649225749999989pt height=14.15524440000002pt/>) variable. For linear regression in its simplest form we assume that both <img src="/Statistics/Regression/tex/332cc365a4987aacce0ead01b8bdcc0b.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=9.39498779999999pt height=14.15524440000002pt/> and <img src="/Statistics/Regression/tex/deceeaf6940a8c7a5a02373728002b0f.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=8.649225749999989pt height=14.15524440000002pt/> are numbers with all the usual properties of numbers. So we **exclude** predicting categories, a problem usually called "linear classification," and predicting probabilities (numbers confined to the interval <img src="/Statistics/Regression/tex/acf5ce819219b95070be2dbeb8a671e9.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=32.87674994999999pt height=24.65753399999998pt/> or <img src="/Statistics/Regression/tex/1e5ba49ae6981862f61b4d510dcf29af.svg?invert_in_darkmode&sanitize=true" align=middle width=36.52973609999999pt height=24.65753399999998pt/>) usually modelled as "logistic regression" or a "generalized linear model."
