# Simple (Multiple) Linear Regression Examples
This directory shows examples of running linear regressions in the following packages/languages/systems:
+ R
+ Python (Statsmodels)
+ SPSS
+ Stata

Because linear regression is a relatively simple and well understood process in science, these examples break the rules a little by showing multiple analyses per file. However, this is justified by the fact that a "complete analysis" of a data set usually includes multiple analyses anyway.
